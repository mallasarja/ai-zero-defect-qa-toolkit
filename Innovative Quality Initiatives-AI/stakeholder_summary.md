## Stakeholder Summary — Innovative Quality Initiatives-AI

Coverage and readiness snapshot from current artifacts.

### Jira Story Coverage
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total Jira Stories (io_stories_last_90d.csv) | 685 |
| Covered by Test Cases | 25 |
| Not Covered (Gaps) | 660 |
| % Coverage | 3.65% |

### Test Case Inventory
| Suite | Count |
|---|---:|
| PR-derived test cases (combined) | 684 |
| API performance/resiliency tests | 12 |
| Tenant configuration tests | 12 |
| Accessibility (LoginForm) tests | 12 |
| Total (approx., distinct suites) | 720 |

### Automation Readiness
| Suite | Automation-Ready |
|---|---:|
| API performance/resiliency | 100% (12/12) |
| Tenant configuration | ~100% (12/12) |
| Accessibility (LoginForm) | ~92% (11/12; contrast manual) |
| Blended readiness across above suites | ~97% |

### Top 3 Regression Risks
1) Multipart form-data flows (IO-137331 references): concurrency, gateway limits, retries
2) Payment resiliency under spikes (idempotency, 429/5xx backoff, duplicate prevention)
3) Timestamp/validation regressions impacting pipeline gating and UI validation cues

### Key Untested Areas
- 660 Jira stories currently have no mapped test case file (3.65% coverage overall).
- Prioritization metadata (High/Medium/Low) not yet embedded in PR-derived tests.
- Limited a11y focus management (first-invalid focus) and contrast verification.

### Recommendations (Next Sprint)
- Generate targeted test cases for the top 50 Jira stories by customer impact and recency; aim to lift coverage to ≥ 12%.
- Automate and gate in CI/CD:
  - Payment spike/retry/idempotency suite (PERF-PAYMENT-*)
  - Multipart form-data soak and spike (orders/shipment as applicable)
  - Tenant config flag toggles and autosync cadence checks
- Add priority tags to PR-derived test files and re-run priority summaries.
- Close a11y gaps: implement first-invalid focus; validate contrast themes; convert applicable a11y checks to automated.
- Establish nightly soak jobs and weekly spike tests; publish SLO dashboards (%P95, error rates).
