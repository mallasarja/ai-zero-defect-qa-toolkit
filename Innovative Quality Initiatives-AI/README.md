# Innovative Quality Initiatives - AI

This project contains AI-assisted QA assets, dashboards, automation readiness reports, Jira story test cases, Slack-derived test cases, and validation summaries used to accelerate quality.

- `jira_inputs/` and `jira_stories/`: input stories and generated test cases
- `pr_test_cases/` and `pr_linkage/`: PR context and test cases
- `slack_e2e/` and `slack_test_cases/`: Slack-derived E2E context and tests
- `test_cases/` and `validation/`: story test cases and AI vs manual validation
- `reference/`: help docs, templates, examples
- `sample_ui/`: sample UI components

cd ai-zero-defect-qa-toolkit/Innovative\ Quality\ Initiatives-AI
```
