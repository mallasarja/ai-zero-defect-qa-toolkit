# Zendesk 254254 — Test Cases
- Ticket: https://celigosuccess.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/254254
- Jira: 
- Feature/Component: N/A
- UI/BE Side: N/A
- Context: Seems like Config issue , not a bug — the issue seems to be with the vendor lookup step not returning results for some records during the flow run. This usually happens if the vendor name or code in the data doesn’t exactly match what’s in NetSuite (e.g., extra spaces, different casing, or missing filters). When the lookup fails, the vendor internal ID stays empty, and since it's required, the record gets silently skipped during import. Support team looking into it will check response from customer , will keep an eye on this for further analysis

## Backend Layer
- **Test Case ID:** 254254-Backend-REG-01
- **Title/Description:** Regression: previously failing scenario does not reoccur
- **Preconditions:
  - Auth and configs valid; realistic data available
  - Layer: Backend
- **Test Steps:
  - 1) Prepare environment and prerequisites
  - 2) Execute action(s) per scenario
  - 3) Observe outputs, logs, and side effects
- **Test Data:
  - API endpoint: provide URL and auth
  - Payload: representative JSON with boundary conditions
- **Expected Result:
  - - Positive: behavior matches spec without errors
  - - Negative: clear validation or bounded retry; no crash
  - - Edge: policy-conformant handling of extremes
- **Actual Result:** TBD
- **Status:** Not Executed
- **Postconditions:** System stable; resources cleaned
- **Tags/Labels:** [regression, backend, escape=false, release=false]
- **Test Type:** Regression
