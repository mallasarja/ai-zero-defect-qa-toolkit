# Zendesk 255061 — Test Cases
- Ticket: https://celigosuccess.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/255061
- Jira: 
- Feature/Component: N/A
- UI/BE Side: N/A
- Context: This is expected behavior, not a bug, because the Transformation Rules 2.0 engine was intentionally updated to return [null] for fields that are missing or have null values in the input payload, as part of a design change to standardize and unify null handling across transformations. This output accurately represents the state of the input data, and the transformation logic executed without errors or unexpected failures, confirming it operated as intended. The same payload that previously produced different results now returns [null], indicating a controlled change in logic rather than a misconfiguration or system defect. While this led to issues downstream—such as output filters ignoring records or scripts failing—it stemmed from pre-existing flows not handling [null], not from a malfunction in the transformation engine itself. Therefore, although the change introduced breaking behavior, it aligns with the new transformation design

## Backend Layer
- **Test Case ID:** 255061-Backend-REG-01
- **Title/Description:** Regression: previously failing scenario does not reoccur
- **Preconditions:
  - Auth and configs valid; realistic data available
  - Layer: Backend
- **Test Steps:
  - 1) Prepare environment and prerequisites
  - 2) Execute action(s) per scenario
  - 3) Observe outputs, logs, and side effects
- **Test Data:
  - API endpoint: provide URL and auth
  - Payload: representative JSON with boundary conditions
- **Expected Result:
  - - Positive: behavior matches spec without errors
  - - Negative: clear validation or bounded retry; no crash
  - - Edge: policy-conformant handling of extremes
- **Actual Result:** TBD
- **Status:** Not Executed
- **Postconditions:** System stable; resources cleaned
- **Tags/Labels:** [regression, backend, escape=false, release=false]
- **Test Type:** Regression
