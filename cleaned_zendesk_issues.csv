The error message:
Variable $input of type ProductSetInput! was provided invalid value for nsshipping:packsize (Field is not defined on ProductSetInput)
is being returned directly from Shopify’s API,This indicates that Shopify no longer recognizes nsshipping:packsize as a valid field in its product update input schema.
The issue is not caused by a bug, but rather by a Shopify configuration change.
Specifically:
The metafield nsshipping:packsize may have been deleted, renamed, or is no longer linked to products in Shopify's custom data settings.
Shopify expects all metafields to be either defined in the admin interface or updated through a specific metafields structure.

,,https://celigosuccess.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/255061,Mallasarja Bapusaheb Desai,"This is expected behavior, not a bug, because the Transformation Rules 2.0 engine was intentionally updated to return [null] for fields that are missing or have null values in the input payload, as part of a design change to standardize and unify null handling across transformations. This output accurately represents the state of the input data, and the transformation logic executed without errors or unexpected failures, confirming it operated as intended. The same payload that previously produced different results now returns [null], indicating a controlled change in logic rather than a misconfiguration or system defect. While this led to issues downstream—such as output filters ignoring records or scripts failing—it stemmed from pre-existing flows not handling [null], not from a malfunction in the transformation engine itself. Therefore, although the change introduced breaking behavior, it aligns with the new transformation design",No,NAN,,,,,,,,,False
